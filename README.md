# Phosphorum 2

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/phalcon/forum.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/phalcon/forum)

Phosphorum is an engine for building flexible, clear and fast forums.
You can adapt it to your own needs or improve it if you want.

Please write us if you have any feedback.

It is used by:
* [Phalcon Framework Forum][15]
* [Zephir Language Forum][16]

## NOTE

The master branch will always contain the latest stable version. If you wish
to check older versions or newer ones currently under development, please
switch to the relevant [branch][19]/[tag][20].

## Get Started

### Requirements

To run this application on your machine, you need at least:

* [Curl][1] extension
* [Openssl][2] extension
* Internationalization ([intl][3]) extension
* Mbstring ([mbstring][4]) extension
* [Composer][5]
* PHP >= 5.5
* [Apache][6] Web Server with [mod_rewrite][7] enabled or [Nginx][8] Web Server
* Latest stable [Phalcon Framework release][9] extension enabled
* [Beanstalkd][10] server

### Installation

Install composer in a common location or in your project:

```sh
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Create the `composer.json` file as follows:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "phalcon/forum": "~3.0"
    }
}
```

Run the composer installer:

```sh
$ php composer.phar install
```

Then you'll need to create the database and initialize schema:

```sh
$ echo 'CREATE DATABASE forum CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci' | mysql -u root
$ cat schemas/forum.sql | mysql -u root phosphorum
```

Copy environment config:

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Copy application config:

```sh
$ cp app/config/config.example.php app/config/config.php
```

You can override application configuration by creating development configuration:

```sh
$ cp app/config/development.example.php app/config/development.php
```

#### Schema Changes

Changes to the database that you need to spend if your version...

* Older than 2.0.0: `schemas/upgrade-to-2.0.0.sql`
* Older than 2.0.1: `schemas/upgrade-to-2.0.1.sql`

#### Initial Test Data

You can create fake entries on an empty Phosphorum installation by running:

```bash
$ php scripts/random-entries.php
```

#### Directory Permissions

After installing Phosphorum, you may need to configure some permissions.
Directories within the `app/cache` and the `app/logs` directory should be writable by your web server or **Phosphorum will not run**.

#### OAuth

This application uses [Github as authentication system][18], you need a client id and secret id
to be set up in the configuration (`app/config/config.php`).

#### Starting the Beanstalkd client

A PHP client to deliver e-mails must be enabled in background:

```bash
$ php scripts/send-notifications-consumer.php &
```

You can serve it with [Supervisor][17] by using following config:

```ini
; /etc/supervisor/conf.d/send-notifications-consumer.conf
;
; This is axample.
; Please update config according to your environment

[program:notifications_consumer]
command=/usr/bin/php send-notifications-consumer.php
directory=/var/www/forum/scripts/
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=www-data
stderr_logfile=/var/www/forum/app/logs/notification_consumer.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/www/forum/app/logs/notification_consumer.out.log
```

## Tests

Phosphorum use [Codeception][11] functional, acceptance and unit tests.

First you need to re-generate base classes for all suites:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/codecept build
```

Sure, for acceptance tests you also need [Selenium server][12] executable as well.
You need Java installed in order to run the Selenium server. You can launch it by running this:

```bash
$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar
```

> Note: replace 2.53.1 to your version.

> Note: Selenium may not support the most recent versions of Firefox.

Execute all test with `run` command:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/codecept run
# OR
$ vendor/bin/codecept run --debug # Detailed output
```

Execute `unit` test with `run unit` command:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/codecept run unit
```
